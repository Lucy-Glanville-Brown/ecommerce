#### Colours

[Adobe Color Extract Theme](https://color.adobe.com/create/image)

<img src="static/media/README/theme_colour_scheme.png" style="height:300px; width:500px;">

[MyColor.Space](https://mycolor.space/)

Using the colors found on Adobe Color Extract Theme I selected the colour palette below from MyColor.Space

<img src="static/media/README/theme_colorspace.png" style="height:200px; width:400px;">

[Contrast Grid - Eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp)

Once the colours were chosen I used a contrast checker to decide which colour I liked best for the Navbar and Footer with white text.

<img src="static/media/README/theme_contrastgrid.png" style="height:600px; width:600px;">


[WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

Finally I used the WebAIM contrast checker to find the right shade of green which would pass all accessibility test with white text.

<img src="static/media/README/theme_contrast_checker.png" style="height:500px; width:500px;">


#### Typography

I decided to use ‘Montserrat’ for the Plant Spot branding and ‘Lato’ and sans-serif for the remaining text.
